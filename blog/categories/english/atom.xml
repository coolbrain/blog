    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><p>when I read the passage, I always can't consciously distinguish the fact and opinion. Sometimes I think the author's personal opinion as the fact.if having chance to talk with other's, I boast about their opionion though I don't know which is original, objective or personal view.The most fearest thing is that I put them into practice and consequently find that they are wrong and liable and I have already wasted a lot of time and done harm to myself.</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>For example,"no man ever look at the world with pristine eyes. He sees it edited by a definite set of customs and institutions and ways of thinking." It sounds reasonable, and may be objective.To persuade reader, the author consequently list fact and eminent man's word to support his opinion. Our teacher taught us in junior school.</p>
<p>"Boardly speaking, human being may be divided into three classes:those who are toiled to death, those who are worried to death, and those who are bored to death."The author acquires this opinion according to his observation and reflection. Whatever, he spares no effort to supporting and describing his opinion."The seeds must be carefully chosen; they must fall on good ground;they must be sedulouly tended, if the vivifying fruits are to be at hand when needed." he uses metaphor describing the process of cultivating hobbies to make reader be aware of the importance of it.</p>
<p>"The undulating waves of the open sea are generated by three natural causes:wind, earth movements or tremors, and the gravitational pull of the moon and the sun."This is fact based on the result of current research which may be overthrowed in the future.It's natural phenomenon. "Appreciaton of sculpture depends upon the ability to respond to form in three dimensions." It seems opinion but it's fact.</p>
<p>"This is a sceptical age, but although our faith in many of the things in which our forefathers fervently believed has weakened, our confidence in the curative properties of the bootle of medicine remains the same as theirs".Why does the author have this opinion? "This modern faith in medicines is proved by the fact that the annual drug bill of the Health Services is mounting to astronomical figures and shows no signs at present of ceasing to rise." he gets it based on data which we can check on the internet. If the author want to cheat, he may forge some data or fact to support his opinion. Maybe we carelessly trust and suffer a lot.</p></p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><p>新概念英语我只是仰慕、走马观花，但一直都没有细心研读。因此英语停滞不前，人要用心，才会学有所成，而不是应付了事。时间不留人，荒废的青春会一去不复返，这是人人都是平等的。应该用在哪些地方，如何是用，怎样规划？这些都是需要思考的地方。</p>
<!-- more -->
<p>《Concept Second》的句子都基本上是简单句，如，The manager was sympathetic, but he could do nothing（来源于 It could be worse).</p>
<p>《Concept Third》的句子略加复杂，如，Yet, in real life, circumstances do sometimes conspire to bring about coincidences which anyone but a nineteenth century novelist would find incredible（来源于 a chance in a million).这个句子里有定语从句。</p>
<p>《Concept Fourth》的句子就已经很复杂了，如, Young men who have reason to fear that they will be killed in battle may justifiably feel bitter in the thought that they have been cheated of the best things that life has to offer(来源于 how to grow old）.这句子里有三个定语从句，一个宾语从句。</p>
<p>由此可见，新概念英语从句子的长度、复杂度，题材的思考度来定义的。其许多文章的内容都值得去深思。如上面一篇文章《how to grow old》,就是教老人如何安度晚年的，属于心理范畴；《Youth》是谈论青年问题的；《Education》是谈论教育问题的。这些文章都是议论性的文章，在学习的时候，不但要懂得阐述文章上的观点，而且还要发表自己的看法，而不是人云亦云。要深入地学习文章，就要研讨它们，而不是有大概印象，或者大概有这回事的糊涂想法。</p></p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p><p>Today is a good beginning because I spare the time not watching TV but constructing my own blog.Eventually, I can almost control everything in my field. There is no useless links,no disgusting advertisements, no boring replies.The things existing in blog is very fantastic,invaluable and wonderful.Every time I see them,my mind becomes clear.</p>

<p> I am willing to share a saying:"yesterday is history,tomorrow is mystery,but today is gift." So Today is precious  because it would be yesterday's result and decides the tomorrow.Don't let myself be addicted in guilty of yesterday's mistakes.In the meantime, don't let tomorrow's uncertainty upset me.</p>
<p><strong>Because I am a programmer, this blog is used as the analysis of monetdb,including source code and design architecture.</strong>this is the example of highlighting the code</p>

<p>Ok, the things I should have been done will be finished now!</p>
<p>Luckily, I would show some pictures when were token in climbing Baiyun mountain with brothers.</p>
<img src="/assets/images/mountain.jpg" alt="&quot;BAT&quot;" />
<p>Wo! I am climbing a tree,but I want to tell you a secret,It's hard to climb and I feel horrible and painful after it.</p>
<img src="/assets/images/tree.jpg" alt="&quot;tree&quot;" />
<p>I can't show the pictures anymore because they slow down my website and I can't bear low velocity,that will kill myself.Maybe there are effective methods to solve this problem which I will find out in next day.</p>
<p>Even though the blog can run normally,but there are many things waitting me to do.It's just a beginning,not an end.</p></p></blockquote>
